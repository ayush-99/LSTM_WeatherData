# LSTM_WeatherData
Working on weather data which is a time-series data, performing various univariate and multivariate LSTM model implementations
Also implemented a model which predicts multiple future points instead of just one
Visualized results and output seen of such models and performing hyper-parameter tuning for achieveing a better model
